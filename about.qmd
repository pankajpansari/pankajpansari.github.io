I am a Visiting Faculty member in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence division of Plaksha University, where I teach courses on Computer Systems and Operating Systems. My current research interests lie in benchmarking reasoning abilities of LLMs.

I completed my PhD under Dr. Pawan Mudigonda in the OVAL group at University of Oxford, where I worked on optimization problems arising in machine learning. I've been a Research Scientist at Naver Labs Europe in Grenoble, France. I also worked as a Data Analyst at General Electric in Bangalore, India.

I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
