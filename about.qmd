I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence division of Plaksha University, where I teach courses on Operating Systems and ML Systems. My research interests lie in improving reasoning abilities of LLMs and on speeding up inference and training of LLMs.

I completed my PhD under Dr. Pawan Mudigonda in the OVAL group at University of Oxford, where I worked on optimization problems arising in machine learning. Post-PhD, I was a Research Scientist at Naver Labs Europe in Grenoble, France. I also worked as Data Analyst at General Electric in Bangalore, India. I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
    
I am teaching [ML Systems](https://ai4103-mlsys.github.io/) at Plaksha University during Monsoon, 2025. I wrote [code-critique](https://github.com/pankajpansari/code-critique), a tool for giving automated feedback on implementation quality of programming assignments; I've found it useful for my own courses.
